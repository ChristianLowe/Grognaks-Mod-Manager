Grognak's Mod Manager
=====================

Grognak's Mod Manager, or GMM for short, is a program designed to make it easy to install multiple [FTL](http://www.ftlgame.com/) mods at the same time. No longer do you have to pack and unpack files or swap out each mod you want to use one at a time.
