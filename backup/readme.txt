When you patch FTL, backups of the game resources will be created here if they don't already exist. Thereafter, the backups will be used as the definitive 'vanilla' dats, which will be unpacked to a temp folder, patched, and used to replace the game's resources.

If you upgrade FTL, delete the *.bak files in this folder so GMM will make fresh backups from the current version.
